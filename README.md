# Kleisli composition in C++14
After reading [Daniel J. H.'s blog post on "An Intuitive Use-Case For Monadic Bind and Kleisli Composition"](https://daniel-j-h.github.io/post/intuitive-monadic-bind-kleisli-composition/), I decided to implement the concepts he mentions in C++14.
This is just a proof of concept, not production code.
